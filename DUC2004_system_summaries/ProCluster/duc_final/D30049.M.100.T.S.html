The United States and North Korea are seeking to inspect an underground nuclear weapons facility in North Korea.
U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North Korea is nuclear related.
The North Koreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear weapons.
The suspicious site officials fear could be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear weapons program.
The United States refuses a U.S. inspection of the site.
A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could have more secret underground nuclear facilities than feared.
South Korea's President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear site.
